Toy (game?) about folding paper

![](screencast.gif)

Using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + THREE.js. Started off as a jsfiddle, so structure
very monolithic. 

Chain of thoughts leading to starting this project:

 1. Sit at a restaurant Fujiya of Japan in Zurich.
 2. They have chopsticks wrapped in a paper with their logotype.
 3. Notice that when you fold the paper right way, you can create words.
 4. How about I create a game that allows you to fold paper to uncover hidden pictures?
